  <h1>Privacy Policy for Mocklet</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 20/08/2025<br>
  <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 20/08/2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Mocklet ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our cryptocurrency demo application handles your information when you use our services.</p>

  <h2>What is Mocklet?</h2>
  <p>Mocklet is a cryptocurrency demonstration application that allows users to practice trading with fake money on real cryptocurrency market data. The app is designed for educational and simulation purposes only and does not involve real money or actual cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We only collect <strong>your email address</strong> if you choose to log in, which is stored securely in <strong>Firebase</strong>. No other personal information is collected. This means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email is stored on Google’s Firebase servers, not on our servers</li>
    <li>We do not have direct access to any other personal or financial data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal identification information beyond email (name, phone number, etc.)</li>
    <li>No financial information or payment details</li>
    <li>No device identifiers or tracking data</li>
    <li>No usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
    <li>No location information</li>
    <li>No contact lists or social media connections</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All other app data is stored locally on your device, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your demo portfolio and trading history</li>
    <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    <li>Simulated transaction records</li>
    <li>Watchlists and favorites</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data remains entirely on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

  <h2>Real Market Data</h2>
  <p>While Mocklet displays real cryptocurrency market data for demonstration purposes, this data is obtained from public sources and does not involve sharing any of your personal information with data providers.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> To securely store your email if you choose to log in</li>
    <li><strong>Market Data Providers:</strong> Public cryptocurrency market data</li>
    <li><strong>App Performance Tools:</strong> Basic crash reporting (no personal data included)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services <strong>do not receive any additional personally identifiable information</strong> from you.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data security depends on your device’s security settings</li>
    <li>We recommend using device lock screens and keeping your device updated</li>
    <li>If you uninstall the app, all local data will be permanently deleted</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For email stored in Firebase, security is managed by Google according to Firebase policies.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Mocklet does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we collect <strong>only email optionally</strong>, the app can be safely used by minors under parental supervision for educational purposes.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your local data is visible within the app</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes all local data permanently; you can also delete your email from your account if you logged in</li>
    <li><strong>Modification:</strong> You can modify or reset your demo portfolio at any time</li>
    <li><strong>Export:</strong> You may manually export your trading history if needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and will take effect immediately upon posting. Your continued use of Mocklet after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Mocklet is a simulation app only. It does not provide real cryptocurrency trading, investment advice, or financial services. All transactions are simulated with fake money for educational purposes only.</p>
